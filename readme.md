# Investigating the Ford GoBike System Data
## by Afnan AlRashoud


## The data we chose for this project is the Ford GoBike System

> The data set includes information about bike trips made using the system Ford GoBike.


## Summary of Findings

> In univariate observation, we noticed that the total numbers made by subscribers were higher by a huge percentage than customers' total trip. This observation is still the same even after dividing these two groups based on their genders and age.
> Although the number of trips made male exceeds the one made female (by a huge difference!), we notice the average trip duration among female trips last more. Same observation has been noted when comparing the cutomers ans subscribers.
> We noticed that none of the trips were made by elderly females (older than 69). Also, none of the trips records a user who is aged 17 or less.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> We'll include only the plots that are easily read by normal audience.
